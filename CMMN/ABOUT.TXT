About HI files:
This is a collection of modules in which most of the routines are completely
tested and debugged... mostly.
Most text program routines differ from graphic routines by having a 0 in the
title to make converting text programs easier.  The x and y values will have
to be converted. See FUNCTIONs Mapx8 and Mapx16

Any modules with duplicate routine names are not intended to be used
together.

Note:  For those of you that don't know, QuickBASIC uses *.MAK
files to determine which files are to be loaded into the environment

*.OBJ files are included for the assembler files for those who do not
have an assembler.  Consult the QuickBASIC Manual on how to make LIB
files and QLB files

Load file ULINK.BAS for more Info

If you have an earlier version of this collection you may want to keep
a backup of it in case this one breaks whatever it is you wrote using
the old version

NOTE: Sometimes a routine may get moved into another file

New, Incessant ramblings now included
