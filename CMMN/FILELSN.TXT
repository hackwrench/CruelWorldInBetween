Once, I created several binary files and made an error.
All of the binary files were supposed to be the same size, but were all
larger different sizes.  When I fixed the problem, the files
retained their sizes. When I deleted the files and reran the
creation subroutine, the problem was fixed.
The moral of the story is that, even though BINARY open
starts at the beginning of the file, it does not recreate the file anew.
