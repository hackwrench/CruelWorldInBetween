Object Oriented Programming

Let's start with something simple, a text object.
Let's see... a text object has color, a string, and a location.
Or does it also have motion, a background, a border...  SIZE????
maybe we should start with something smaller, a character no
A pixel...
Pixels have size, albeit fixed, though you can have different sized pixels
within different resolutions.  Basically when it comes to pixels and size
all that need to be known is the aspect ratio which is the same for all pixels
at a given resolution
