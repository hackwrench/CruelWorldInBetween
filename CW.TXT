Cruel World

Jeanny, tell me about your family.-DarkWarrior
There really isn't much to say...-JeannyCauldron
When I left them, they were fighting...-JeannyCauldron
They probably didn't even realize I was gone until days after I left.-JeannyCauldron
Jeanny. that probably isn't true.-DarkWarrior
You don't know my family...They can argue for months on end.-JeannyCauldron
Oh.-DarkWarrior
How long has it been since you've seen them.-Arlyn
Arlyn, how long have you been up there?-DarkWarrior
Long enough.-Arlyn
Don't you think you should try to visit them again?-Arlyn
Prehaps I should... though I don't think their behavior has improved-JeannyCauldron
Just in case, I think all of us should go with you.-DarkWarrior
I think it would be safer if I went alone, but if you insist...-JeannyCauldron
Please can we go?-Arlyn
Alright Arlyn...  If we wouldn't be too much of a bother to you...-DarkWarrior
Oh, No bother at all, I was worried about you- your safety and well-being...-JeannyCauldron
I'd have to use magic...-JeannyCauldron
Simon, Crysta, prepare for going on a journey...-DarkWarrior
and join me in Jeanny's Alchemy Lab.-DarkWarrior
